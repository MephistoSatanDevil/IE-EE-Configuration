## About This Project

This project (`IE-EE-Configuration`) is a secondary development and enhancement based on the original [LionAG/IE-EE-Configuration](https://github.com/LionAG/IE-EE-Configuration/) project.

## Features

This is an unofficial configuration utility for **Infinity Engine - Enhanced Edition** games. It allows users to easily change some of the properties that are normally modified through the `Baldur.lua` file.

## Key Improvements

Compared to the original [LionAG/IE-EE-Configuration](https://github.com/LionAG/IE-EE-Configuration/) project, this project primarily adds the following features:

*   **Generalization:** The tool has been improved to automatically scan and locate the configuration file (`Baldur.lua`) of Infinity Engine - Enhanced Edition games within the directory where the program executable resides, and then modify it, eliminating the need for users to specify the path manually.
*   **Multi-language Support:** Added multi-language interface support.
    *   **Currently Supported Languages:** English, Chinese.
